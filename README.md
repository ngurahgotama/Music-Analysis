## Introduction

In this project, you will compare the music preferences of users in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You'll look at actual Y.Music data to test some of the hypotheses below and compare user behavior in the two cities. Three hypotheses are tested:
- User activity varies by day and city.
- On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents tune in to different genres. The same is true on Friday nights.
- Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. Springfield listeners prefer pop music, while Shelbyville listeners prefer rap music.
